# GlobalHealthAlert
It's a decentralized trustless and immutable record for monitoring global public health emergencies. Its a tool for governments, the media, research agencies,  hospitals and single individuals to gain adequate information on the true spread of contagion with a click of a button.

A doctor anywhere around the world, having completed KYC with a proven credential, can record a positively tested case with their properties and geographical coordinates on the blockchain. 

A user can monitor the blockchain through an easy to use web interface on any device. 
It not only reduces the spread of misinformation but also enables international collaboration while being fault-tolerant against the collapse of single centralised data stores.
